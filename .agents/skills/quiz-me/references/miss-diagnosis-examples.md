# Miss Diagnosis, Plain-English Grading & Transfer Question Examples (`quiz-me`)

Use this guide during **Phase 3 (One-Concept-at-a-Time Assessment & Teaching
Loop)** when evaluating user responses or designing a follow-up
`Transfer Question (N_x-T1)`.

- **Credit Plain-English Intuition First (And Require `"Why"` on Inline
  Options)**:
  - Check whether the user's everyday phrasing already captures the causal
    mechanism (for example, saying _"it's making a change w/out a difference"_
    when asked why a noun-swapped transfer question fails). When the intuition
    holds, mark the concept `✅ Mastered` immediately—never withhold credit for
    missing textbook or rubric buzzwords.
  - When a question offers inline `(A)/(B)/(C)` options in plain text, a bare
    letter pick (`"B"`) without a causal `"because..."` explanation does **not**
    prove comprehension—confirm the branch and ask a 1-line _"Why does B happen
    here?"_ before marking `✅ Mastered`.
- **Resist Reflexive Graph Mutation**: Most genuine misses come from an
  ambiguous scenario prompt or a normal gap on the active concept itself,
  neither of which changes the prerequisite graph. Diagnose silently—do **not**
  print a robotic `- **Diagnosis:** ...` header in chat.

## 1. Five-Way Miss Diagnosis Procedure (Evaluate Silently in Order)

When a user's answer misses the target invariant (or the user says `"teach me"`
/ `"not sure"`), walk this decision list top-to-bottom before touching the
graph:

| Order | Diagnosis                                             | Diagnostic Signal                                                                                                                                                                     | Required Action                                                                                                                                                                             | Mutates Graph?   |
| :---- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- |
| **1** | **Ambiguous Scenario Question** _(Agent fault)_       | The user's answer is valid under a reasonable interpretation because your scenario omitted a key boundary condition (e.g., threat capability, concurrency model, or caller contract). | State the missing constraint in 1 sentence and re-ask the tightened check (or grant `✅ Mastered` if their answer already proved the invariant). Do **not** lecture.                        | **No**           |
| **2** | **Active Concept Gap / `"Teach Me"`** _(Normal path)_ | Prerequisites are solid and the prompt was clear, but the user hasn't yet grasped the active `🎯 Ready Next` invariant (or said `"I don't know / teach me"`).                         | Teach the concept **immediately**: deliver a **Teaching Block** (Pedagogy) followed by 1 **Fresh Transfer Question (`N_x-T1`)** (Assessment). Never refuse to explain a question you asked. | **No**           |
| **3** | **Curiosity Tangent**                                 | The user asks about a `🔒 Locked` downstream node or an orthogonal code detail instead of answering the scenario.                                                                     | Answer in 1–2 sentences, name the node that owns that invariant, and re-surface the active `🎯 Ready Next` check.                                                                           | **No**           |
| **4** | **Overloaded Concept**                                | The node bundles two distinct mechanisms that can fail independently; the user proves one and misses the other.                                                                       | Split `N_x` into `N_xa` (`✅ Mastered`) and `N_xb` (`🎯 Ready Next`) with separate `Source` anchors.                                                                                        | **Yes (Split)**  |
| **5** | **Missing Upstream Prerequisite**                     | The user fails because they lack a foundational mechanism _external_ to `N_x` that was never mapped in the index.                                                                     | Explain the immediate catch briefly, insert `N_new -> N_x`, move `N_x` back to `🔒 Locked`, and make `N_new` `🎯 Ready Next`.                                                               | **Yes (Insert)** |

## 2. Worked Diagnosis Examples

### Worked Example A: Ambiguous Scenario Question (Do Not Mutate Graph or Lecture)

- **Active Concept (`N4`)**: `Isolate Message Ownership & TransferableTypedData`
  (`Source: lib/src/worker_pool.dart#L88-L112`)
- **Initial Scenario Check (`N4`)**:
  > _"Worker A sends a `Uint8List` buffer of 50 MB to Worker B over a `SendPort`
  > and then mutates `buffer[0] = 0xFF`. What does Worker B observe, and what
  > happens to memory usage?"_
- **User Reply**:
  > _"If it's sent via `Isolate.exit` or wrapped in `TransferableTypedData`,
  > Worker A can't mutate it afterward and memory isn't copied."_
- **Why Inserting a Node Is Wrong**: The agent intended to test standard
  `SendPort.send(uint8List)` deep-copy semantics, but forgot to specify which
  send API was called. The user's reasoning is sound.
- **Proper Response (Outcome 1 — Ambiguous Scenario)**:
  > _"Good catch on the API boundary—my scenario didn't specify that Worker A
  > called plain `sendPort.send(buffer)` while staying alive (without
  > `TransferableTypedData`). Since you already named both the zero-copy
  > transfer wrapper and the post-transfer mutation restriction, `N4` is
  > `✅ Mastered`."_

### Worked Example B: Active Concept Gap vs. Missing Prerequisite

- **Active Concept (`N5`)**: `Transparency Log Inclusion vs. Active Key Pinning`
  (`Source: docs/attestation_spec.md#section-4.2`)
- **Direct Prerequisites**: `N3: Untrusted Registry Threat Model`
  (`✅ Mastered`)
- **Scenario Check (`N5`)**:
  > _"An attacker compromises a publisher's OIDC workload token for 5 minutes,
  > signs a backdoored release, and records the signature in the public append-
  > only transparency log. Why does transparency-log verification still allow a
  > client to install the compromised package immediately?"_
- **Case 1 — Active Concept Gap (Outcome 2, No Graph Mutation)**:
  - _User Reply_: _"Doesn't the transparency log reject signatures if the build
    didn't come from the official branch?"_
  - _Internal Check_: The user understands `N3` (untrusted registry) and knows
    what an append-only log is, but confuses **auditability** (recording every
    valid signature) with **policy enforcement** (blocking unauthorized branches
    at install time).
  - _Action_: Keep the graph unchanged. Deliver a **Teaching Block** contrasting
    append-only recording (passive security camera) vs. branch/identity policy
    verification (active door lock), then pose `N5-T1`.
- **Case 2 — Missing Upstream Prerequisite (Outcome 5, Insert Node)**:
  - _User Reply_: _"Wait—what is an OIDC workload token, and how can a build
    sign anything without a long-lived private key stored in CI secrets?"_
  - _Internal Check_: The graph jumped straight from `N2: Asymmetric Signatures`
    to `N5: Transparency Logs` without mapping **keyless ephemeral workload
    certificates**. The user cannot reason about a 5-minute OIDC compromise
    until keyless signing is understood.
  - _Action_: Insert `N4: Ephemeral Workload Certificates` (`N2 -> N4 -> N5`),
    move `N5` back to `🔒 Locked`, and teach/probe `N4` as `🎯 Ready Next`.

## 3. Question Design Guardrails & Fresh Transfer Questions (`N_x-T1`)

Every `Scenario Check` and `Transfer Question (N_x-T1)` must test a
**first-principles causal invariant** (_"why / what breaks if..."_), never
memorization trivia. After a `Teaching Block`, change the **failure mode or
scenario mechanics**, not the surface nouns.

| Quality                                                  | Example Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Why It Fails or Succeeds                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid (Trivial / Bureaucratic Convention Question)** | _"What exact string suffix does `quiz-me` forbid in the `Source` column, and what exact badge text does `slice-and-dice` print when code holds up?"_                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Invalid**: Quizzes arbitrary string literals and formatting conventions that cannot be deduced from first principles. State conventions directly; only ask causal _"what breaks if..."_ questions. |
| **Weak `N3-T1` (Noun Swap Only)**                        | _Original (`N3`)*: _"A mirror serves a valid signature for `pkg-a` when the client requested `pkg-b`, and the signed payload omits the package name. How does the attack work?"_ -> _Candidate `N3-T1`_: _"A CDN serves a valid signature for `image-x` when Docker requested `image-y`, and the payload omits the image name. What happens?"_ | **Invalid**: Identical cross-package substitution mechanics with `"pkg"` replaced by `"image"` (a change without a difference).                                                                      |
| **Strong `N3-T1` (New Failure Mode)**                    | _"Now suppose the signed payload includes the exact package name `pkg-b` and `SHA-256` digest, but the registry strips the `attestations` field from the JSON metadata response and serves an older unattested `pkg-b@1.0.0` tarball. If the client only verifies attestations when the field is present, what invariant is violated?"_        | **Valid**: Tests the same `N3` untrusted-intermediary invariant via a **downgrade / stripping failure mode** rather than a **cross-package substitution** failure mode.                              |
