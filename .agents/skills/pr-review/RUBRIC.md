# Review Rubric: 13 Angles & The Inquisitor Doctrine

The model-agnostic code review evaluation rubric. Evaluates changes through 13
analytical lenses and filters candidate findings through the adversarial
Inquisitor doctrine to eliminate reviewer theater and LLM noise.

---

## 🏛️ Part 1: The 13 Analytical Angles

Every pull request diff must be evaluated across these 13 distinct lenses:

### 1. Line Scan

Audit local line-level syntax, types, and logic:

- Nullability mismatches, unsafe bang operators (`!`), unhandled `null`
  branches.
- Off-by-one errors in slice ranges, array indexes, or loop termination bounds.
- Dynamic type casts (`as Foo`) that can throw at runtime without prior type
  checks (`is Foo`).
- Boolean operator precedence and accidental assignment in conditional
  expressions.

### 2. Removed Behavior

Audit what was deleted:

- What invariants, error branches, or validations were removed?
- Does deleted code silently break assumptions in un-modified caller files?
- Were cleanup steps (e.g. closing streams, timers, file handles) accidentally
  dropped?
- Were fallback branches removed prematurely before downstream consumers
  migrated?

### 3. Cross-File Tracer

Trace dependencies beyond the diff hunks:

- Did an interface, signature, or exported type change without updating all call
  sites?
- Do package exports (`lib/<pkg>.dart`, `index.dart`, `__init__.py`, `mod.rs`)
  avoid leaking internal helper types (`export 'src/...' show ...;`)?
- When a refactor extracts helpers across files in a Dart package, require
  public API surface verification (`dart run api_summary@^1.1.0 --check` if
  `api.txt` is tracked, or before/after `api_summary` diff) to guarantee zero
  unintended public API leaks.
- Do mock implementations in test fixtures still mirror the updated production
  contract?

### 4. Language Pitfalls

Check language-specific traps and footguns:

- **Dart / Flutter**:
  - Unawaited futures causing race conditions or floating exceptions.
  - Mutating collections during iteration; missing `toList()` when transforming
    lazy iterables.
  - Stream subscriptions without cancellation in `dispose()`.
  - Passing non-constant expressions into `const` constructors or using mutable
    objects as default arguments.
- **Go**:
  - Goroutine leaks; channels with unbuffered writers that block indefinitely.
  - Mutating loop variables across goroutines; missing `context.Context`
    deadline propagation.
- **Python**:
  - Mutable default arguments (`def foo(bar=[])`).
  - Unbounded global dicts causing memory leaks; catch-all `except:` swallowing
    `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit`.

### 5. Invariants & Wrappers

Inspect abstraction boundaries and invariants:

- Are domain invariants enforced in public constructors or factory methods?
- Does a wrapper type leak its underlying implementation primitives to callers?
- **Load-Bearing Library Boundary Rule (Dart)**: Does a file split widen
  `_private` class members to `@internal` just to extract a separate `lib/src/`
  library? Require `part` / `part of` (`Tier 2`) whenever types share privileged
  library-scoped access (`sealed`, `final`, `interface`, `base`, private
  constructors `._()`, or `_private` members), reserving standalone `lib/src/`
  libraries (`Tier 1`) for cuts with zero visibility widening.
- Are state transitions atomic, or can the object be left in an inconsistent
  intermediate state upon failure?

### 6. Error Handling

Inspect exception and error paths:

- Are exceptions swallowed silently or caught without logging/rethrowing?
- Do functions return ambiguous `null` or `-1` instead of throwing typed,
  informative error classes?
- Is error context preserved when wrapping/re-throwing exceptions?

### 7. Testing (Seam Discipline, Behavioral Assertions & Real Test Doubles)

Scrutinize test quality, seam discipline, and assertion substance (`FU2`):

- **Test Seam Discipline (`lib/<pkg>.dart` vs. `lib/src/` Deep Modules)**:
  - Require package-level and integration tests to import the public
    `package:<pkg>/<pkg>.dart` entrypoint, keeping `lib/<pkg>.dart` exports
    strictly scoped to public consumers.
  - Allow—and encourage—subsystem unit tests to import internal **deep modules**
    (`package:<pkg>/src/<subsystem>.dart`, such as unexported parsers, state
    machines, data models, or algorithms with simple interfaces and rich
    internal logic), while requiring thin single-caller helpers to be tested
    through their owning module's entrypoint.
- **Behavioral & Boundary Assertions**: Require tests to assert observable
  outputs, state transitions, and boundary conditions of code that consumes
  constants and models against concrete expected values (rather than echoing
  constant literals, DTO getters, or production formulas).
- **Direct Execution & Rendering Verification**: Require runtime behavior,
  control flow, and UI/CLI output to be verified by executing functions or
  rendering components directly, reserving raw file-text reads
  (`readAsStringSync()`) for `README.md` `--help` drift checks, `BUILD` /
  `pubspec.yaml` metadata sync, and code-generator fixtures.
- **Real Implementations & First-Party Fakes ("Tests That Can Fail")**: Require
  real implementations (`package:test_descriptor` `d.sandbox`/`d.dir`,
  `Directory.systemTemp`, loopback `HttpServer`, in-memory stores), first-party
  fakes (`package:http/testing.dart` `MockClient`), or real `@TestOn('browser')`
  runs for DOM and JS/Wasm interop so tests exercise real failure modes.
- **Public API Surface Verification**: When refactors extract helpers across
  files, require `dart run api_summary@^1.1.0` diff or `api.txt` verification so
  extracted helpers do not leak into the public package entrypoint.
- Do tests exercise negative paths, timeout behavior, and invalid inputs, or
  only the happy path?
- Does every bug fix include a deterministic regression test reproducing the
  original issue?

### 8. Reuse

Check for wheel reinvention:

- Does the diff introduce helper functions, math algorithms, or string parsers
  that already exist in the standard library, core SDK, or existing project
  dependencies (e.g. `package:collection`, `package:path`, `lodash`, `guava`)?
- Is duplicate helper logic introduced across sibling modules instead of
  consolidating into a common internal utility?

### 9. Simplification

The subtractive lens (eliminate over-engineering):

- Is this more complex than the problem requires?
- Does the change add premature abstractions, single-caller interfaces, stateful
  single-use `_Populator` / `_Runner` helper classes that mutate caller
  maps/sets in-place (prefer pure file-private functions), or speculative
  configuration knobs that nothing uses?
- Can nested conditional branches be flattened with early-return guard clauses
  or switch expressions?

### 10. Efficiency

Audit performance in hot paths:

- Are expensive operations (JSON parsing, regex compilation, reflection,
  filesystem I/O) executed inside tight loops?
- Are collections repeatedly resized or allocated unnecessarily?
- Are lookups performed via $O(N)$ linear scans when a `Set` or `Map` lookup
  would be $O(1)$?

### 11. Altitude

Step back and evaluate high-level architectural coherence:

- Does this feature or logic belong in this package/layer, or does it violate
  separation of concerns?
- Does the change solve the actual user problem, or does it apply a superficial
  band-aid to a deeper structural flaw?

### 12. Readability & Conventions

Verify developer ergonomics and repository norms:

- Are public APIs and exported symbols documented with clear, grammatically
  sound docstrings?
- Do variable and function names convey intent rather than implementation
  mechanics?
- Does the code follow repository style guidelines and pass formatters
  (`dart format`, `gofmt`, `black`)?

### 13. Cyclomatic Complexity

Evaluate nesting and cognitive strain:

- Are functions excessively long (>50 lines) or deeply indented (>3 levels)?
- Does the function carry high Cognitive Complexity (nested loops, branching
  ternary operators, nested lambdas)?
- Can complex logic be decomposed into pure, testable sub-functions?

## ⚖️ Part 2: The Inquisitor Doctrine ("Presumption of Theater")

**Every candidate review finding is reviewer theater and pedantic noise until
proven otherwise.**

LLM reviewers suffer from severe incentive bias: they invent imaginary hazards
to prove they performed work. The Inquisitor acts as an adversarial filter. A
finding MUST demonstrate concrete, mechanical proof of runtime defect or
measurable maintenance harm, or face summary dismissal.

### The Five Inquisitorial Filters

Filter every candidate finding against these five pathologies:

1. **Imaginary Architecture & Unverified Assumptions**:
   - _Trap_: The reviewer assumes an execution model, threading model, or API
     contract absent from the codebase.
   - _Rule_: If the reviewer cannot cite an exact call site or contractual
     specification proving the assumption, **DISMISS** as
     `[DISMISSED: INVENTED_ARCHITECTURE]`.

2. **Synchronous Hand-Wringing & Defensive Paranoia**:
   - _Trap_: Demanding thread locks, async mutexes, or memory barriers in
     single-threaded, synchronous execution paths.
   - _Rule_: If the scenario requires impossible execution interleavings or
     paranoid double-checks, **DISMISS** as `[DISMISSED: PARANOIA]`.

3. **Pedantic Escalation**:
   - _Trap_: Elevating minor stylistic preferences, harmless setup repetition,
     or test fixture boilerplate to "architectural flaws".
   - _Rule_: If the code causes zero measurable harm to maintainability or
     runtime safety, **DISMISS** as `[DISMISSED: PEDANTIC_ESCALATION]`.

4. **Harmless Idempotence & Belt-and-Suspenders**:
   - _Trap_: Complaining about defensive null-checks, idempotent resets, or
     explicit cleanups because "the framework already handles it".
   - _Rule_: If the pattern is harmless defensive programming that does not harm
     readability or performance, **DISMISS** as `[DISMISSED: HARMLESS]`.

5. **Hallucinated Dependencies & APIs**:
   - _Trap_: Suggesting the author use third-party libraries, non-existent SDK
     methods, or unverified packages.
   - _Rule_: If the proposed replacement symbol or dependency cannot be verified
     to exist in the repository's active dependencies or language SDK,
     **DISMISS** as `[DISMISSED: HALLUCINATED_API]`.

## 🎯 Part 3: Severity Verdicts

Only findings that survive the Inquisitor filters are reported. Assign exactly
one severity:

- **🚨 `[BLOCKING]`**: Must be addressed before merge. Correctness bugs, data
  loss, race conditions, broken tests, security vulnerabilities, or public API
  breaks.
- **💡 `[SUGGESTION]`**: Highly recommended improvements. Measurable performance
  wins, significant simplification, eliminating wheel reinvention, or missing
  edge-case test coverage.
- **🧹 `[HYGIENE_NIT]`**: Minor polish (dead imports, typos, docstring drift).
  Keep only if accompanied by confirmed defects or high signal. If the PR has
  zero blocking defects and zero suggestions, suppress cosmetic nits to deliver
  a clean approval.
