## 1. When to use this skill

Use this skill when analyzing Dart and Flutter codebase maintainability,
evaluating function readability, or remediating high-complexity warning
findings. Unlike traditional Cyclomatic Complexity (which linearly counts
branching paths and punishes clean declarative table switches), Cognitive
Complexity directly measures the comprehension friction required for a
human or reviewing LLM to read and simulate control flow.

Specifically, target methods and classes matching these indicators:
*   **Deeply Nested Control Flow**: Functions exhibiting multiple layers of
    enclosing conditionals (`if`, `for`, `while`), where indentation obscures
    logic.
*   **Convoluted Conditional Trees**: Functions employing verbose `if-else`
    or `else if` chains instead of modern Dart 3 exhaustive pattern matching
    or table-driven switches.
*   **Monolithic Method Bodies**: Functions that breach operational complexity
    thresholds during evaluation or static analysis audits.
*   **God Classes**: Logic classes exceeding structural line-count ceilings
    (excluding declarative Flutter `build` methods).

### Discovery Commands (Targeting Hot-Spots)

Run read-only discovery commands to identify nesting hot-spots before
calculating scores:

```bash
# Locate functions with deeply nested conditionals (4+ levels of indentation on flow-breaking statements)
grep -rnE '^\s{8,}(if|for|while|switch)\s*\(' lib/

# Locate verbose if-else ladders ripe for Dart 3 switch expression refactoring
grep -rnE '^\s*\} else if \(' lib/
```

## 2. Algorithmic Scoring Rules for Dart

Calculate Cognitive Complexity algorithmically using three deterministic
scoring rules:

### Rule 1: Benign Shorthand & Switches (+0 Penalty)
No base points or nesting multipliers are added for idiomatic Dart syntax
that consolidates operations into scannable expressions:
*   **Null-Aware Operators & Cascades**: `??`, `?.`, `??=`, null-aware spreads
    (`...?`), null-aware collection elements (`?item`), and cascade notation
    (`..`) cost +0 points.
*   **Dart 3 Switch Statements & Expressions**: An entire exhaustive `switch`
    block costs exactly +1 base point, regardless of whether it evaluates
    3 or 50 `case` or pattern arms. Case labels receive +0 points.

### Rule 2: Flow Interruption (+1 Base)
Add +1 base point whenever execution diverges from linear top-to-bottom
reading flow:
*   **Conditionals & Ternaries**: `if`, `else if`, `else`, and conditional
    expressions (`cond ? x : y`).
*   **Iterators**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and collection `for` / `if`
    clauses inside list literals.
*   **Exception Catching**: `catch` / `on` blocks (`try` and `finally` cost +0).
*   **Logical Operator Switches**: Consecutive strings of identical operators
    (`a && b && c`) count as +1 total. Alternating operator families
    (`a && b || c`) adds +1 per alternation.

### Rule 3: The Nesting Multiplier (+D Depth)
Whenever a flow-breaking structure (from Rule 2) is nested inside another
structural block, add its structural nesting depth (D) to the base cost:
*   Top-level `if` (D=0): +1 base = +1 point.
*   `for` loop nested inside that `if` (D=1): +1 base + 1 depth = +2 points.
*   Inner `if` inside the `for` (D=2): +1 base + 2 depth = +3 points.
*   **Flat Multiplicity Exceptions**: Unlike conditional openers and loops,
    `else`, `else if`, and `catch` / `on` structures receive only a flat +1
    base penalty without incurring depth nesting multipliers.

## 3. Execution & Delegation Strategy

Line-by-line complexity arithmetic consumes high token bandwidth. Apply
adaptive delegation to preserve primary context:
*   **Subagent by Default (Files, Libraries, PRs)**: When evaluating entire
    files, directories, or multi-class architectures, invoke a `self` or
    `Researcher` read-only subagent assigned the role `Complexity Auditor`
    to handle file reads and scoring calculations. Instruct the subagent to
    return only an aggregated scoreboard listing methods that breach complexity
    thresholds, along with their exact line ranges and failing structures.
*   **Inline Computation (Micro-Scope)**: Calculate complexity scores
    directly in the primary context window solely when inspecting tiny code
    snippets (< 50 lines) pasted directly in chat or during immediate
    post-refactoring verification of an individual modified method block.
*   **Immutability Guardrail**: Subagent complexity evaluators must operate
    strictly in read-only mode to prevent unintended workspace mutations during
    audit sweeps.

---

## 4. Actionable Thresholds & Calibration

*   **Production Logic Functions**: Target score <= 15. Functions exceeding
    15 points mandate architectural refactoring.
*   **Test Methods (`_test.dart`)**: Target score <= 40. Test harnesses
    tolerate higher structural setup sequences before decomposition is required.
*   **Class Size Ceiling**: Logic classes (services, domain objects,
    controllers) should remain <= 150 non-comment lines.
*   **Flutter UI Calibration**: Do not enforce the 150 LOC class ceiling on
    declarative Flutter `build` methods, as widget wrappers consume vertical
    space without increasing cognitive logic load. Instead, enforce a
    **Widget Tree Nesting Ceiling** of maximum 5 horizontal indentation
    levels before extracting discrete helper widget classes.

## 5. Refactoring Strategies & Dart Patterns

When remediating functions that breach complexity ceilings, apply these
Dart-specific architectural refactorings:

### Pattern A: Replace Nested If-Else with Dart 3 Switch Expression

#### Before: Deeply Nested Conditionals (Score: 12)
```dart
int resolveTimeout(String protocol, bool isSecure, int retryCount) {
  if (protocol == 'http') {          // D=0 -> +1 (if)
    if (isSecure) {                  // D=1 -> +2 (if + depth 1)
      if (retryCount > 3) {          // D=2 -> +3 (if + depth 2)
        return 5000;
      } else {                       // D=2 -> +1 (else flat)
        return 3000;
      }
    } else {                         // D=1 -> +1 (else flat)
      return 1000;
    }
  } else if (protocol == 'ftp') {    // D=0 -> +1 (else if flat) +3 (nested...)
    return isSecure ? 10000 : 2000;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### After: Table-Driven Switch Expression (Score: 1)
```dart
int resolveTimeout(String protocol, bool isSecure, int retryCount) =>
    switch ((protocol, isSecure, retryCount)) {  // D=0 -> +1 (switch expression)
      ('http', true, > 3) => 5000,               // Case arms cost +0
      ('http', true, _) => 3000,
      ('http', false, _) => 1000,
      ('ftp', true, _) => 10000,
      ('ftp', false, _) => 2000,
      _ => 0,
    };                                           // Total complexity reduction: 12 -> 1
```

---

### Pattern B: Guard Clause Inversion (Flattening Nesting Depth)

Invert conditional checks into early guard return statements
(`if (!condition) return;`). Every early exit strips away a layer of nesting
multiplication from subsequent downstream logic.

#### Before: Pyramid of Nesting (Score: 11)
```dart
Future<void> syncPayload(User? user, Payload? data) async {
  if (user != null) {                      // D=0 -> +1
    if (user.hasPermission) {              // D=1 -> +2 (if + depth 1)
      if (data != null && data.isValid) {  // D=2 -> +3 (if + depth 2) +1 (&&)
        for (final item in data.items) {   // D=3 -> +1 (for) + 3 depth = +4
          await repository.save(item);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### After: Early Exit Guard Clauses (Score: 5)
```dart
Future<void> syncPayload(User? user, Payload? data) async {
  if (user == null || !user.hasPermission) return; // D=0 -> +1 (if) +1 (||) = +2
  if (data == null || !data.isValid) return;       // D=0 -> +1 (if) +1 (||) = +2

  for (final item in data.items) {                 // D=0 -> +1 (for at zero depth)
    await repository.save(item);
  }
}
```

### Pattern C: Encapsulated Method Object Extraction

When a monolithic function contains dense closures capturing heavy local
variable state that prevents simple function extraction, migrate the function
body into a dedicated private runner class using the
**`encapsulated-method-object`** skill. Read the `encapsulated-method-object`
skill instructions via `view_file` before applying this refactoring. Promoting
local variables to class instance fields collapses closure nesting penalties
and unlocks focused helper method decomposition.

## 6. Verification Guardrails

Run these verification commands before submitting refactored code:

1.  **Code Presentation**: Run `dart format .` to maintain uniform syntactic
    styling.
2.  **Static Analysis**: Run `dart analyze` to ensure zero static warnings,
    lint violations, or un-awaited asynchronous gaps.
3.  **Test Fidelity**: Run `dart test` (or `flutter test`) to verify zero
    behavioral drift across existing test suites.
